                <td id = "article1"><h3>Solar panels</h3>Solar panels (aka "PV panels") are used to convert sunlight, which is composed of energy particles called "photons", into electricity that can 
                    be used to power electrical charges. Arrays of a photovoltaic system supply solar electricity to electrical equipment. The development of solar 
                    energy takes more than 100 years. Solar panels collect clean and renewable energy, such as sunlight, and convert this collected light into 
                    electricity, which can then be used to power electrical charges.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><h3>Charge controller</h3> A solar charge controller is a voltage or current controller used to charge the battery and prevent electric cells from overcharging. 
                    It transmits the voltage and current from the solar panel to the electric cell. The solar charge controller comes in three different 
                    types, and these are: Simple 1 or 2 stage controls, PWM (pulse width modulated) and Maximum power point monitoring (MPPT). Solar 
                    Charge Controller has lots of advantages, such as: It prevents the battery (12V) from being overcharged, decreases system maintenance 
                    and increases battery usage time, the automatic charge indicator has high reliability, is 10 amp to 40 amp charge current and monitors 
                    reverse current flow.</td>

                <td id = "article5"><h3>DC power</h3>Direct current (DC) is a unidirectional electric current, so the charge flow is always in the same direction. Unlike alternating current, 
                    direct currents do not change their direction and amperage. It is used in many home electronics and all devices that use batteries. Direct 
                    current is used in any electronic device that has a battery for a power supply. It is also used to charge batteries, so rechargeable devices 
                    such as laptops and cell phones come with an AC adapter that converts alternating current to direct current.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><h3>Battery system</h3>A battery is not required for the operation of a simple grid-connected solar power system. Because it uses the grid as an infinitely large 
                    battery. If the solar panels on your roof are generating more power than your home needs, the excess power is transferred to the grid. 
                    Later, if your panels cannot generate enough electricity, energy will be drawn from the grid to close the energy gap. Battery addition 
                    purposes: You don't want to export all of your excess solar energy, instead you want to store it in a battery and if the grid 
                    runs out of power, you want to have a spare power.</td>

                <td id = "article4"><h3>Inverter</h3>It is like a brain in any solar system. Its main function is to change the DC power to AC power generated from the solar panel. It allows the 
                    system to be monitored so that the operators of this system can monitor how this system works. One of the most important decisions you will make 
                    is the type of inverter to be installed, if you are considering a solar panel system for your home. Inverters convert the direct current (DC) 
                    energy produced in the panels into usable alternating current (AC) energy.</td>

                    to direct current (DC) flowing in only one direction. Alternating current is the form in which electrical power is supplied to workplaces and 
                    residences, and is the form of electrical energy that consumers often use when plugging their kitchen appliances, televisions, fans, and electric 
                    lamps into an outlet.</td>
